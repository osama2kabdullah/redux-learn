# Learn Redux with Anisul Islam
This repository contains code and notes for the "Learn Redux with Anisul Islam" YouTube channel. This channel offers a comprehensive introduction to Redux, a popular state management library for JavaScript applications.

### About Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Redux can be used with any UI layer, but it's most commonly used with React.

### About Redux-Thunk
Redux-Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write async logic that interacts with the Redux store. With Redux-Thunk, you can dispatch functions instead of plain objects, which gives you more flexibility in how you handle side effects like API calls, timers, and other asynchronous operations.

### About Redux-Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is an official package from the Redux team that simplifies many common Redux use cases, including store setup, creating reducers, and writing immutable update logic. It includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

### About React-Redux
React-Redux is the official library that connects Redux to React. It provides a set of helper functions that make it easier to interact with the Redux store from React components. With React-Redux, you can write cleaner and more maintainable code, and avoid common pitfalls when working with Redux.

### Getting started
To get started with Redux and the associated libraries, you can follow along with the "Learn Redux with Anisul Islam" YouTube channel. Each video covers a specific topic related to Redux and provides code examples that you can use to follow along.
